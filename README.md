<b>About This Repo</b>
</P>This repository is used to demonstrate the compilation of my SQL work at one place. 
This requires fundamentals Knowledge of SQL query language to perform C.R.U.D(CREATE, READ/RETREIVE, UPDATE, DELETE) using
DDL (Data Defination Language) and DML (Data Modificaiton Language) to query among different tables. Below is spcified the scope of this repository using MySQL Workbench 8.0 which is intended to include SQL Developement, Data Modelling & Data Migration primarily.

<b>Overview</b>
<p>
<em>MySQL Workbench 8.0</em> is a graphical tool for working with MySQL servers and databases. MySQL Workbench fully supports MySQL server versions 5.5 and higher. Used here is MySQL Woekbench 8.0.

<b> Few Things Good To Know Things for MySQL Workbench 8.0:</b>

<b>SQL Development:</b> Enables you to create and manage connections to database servers. Along with enabling you to configure connection parameters, MySQL Workbench provides the capability to execute SQL queries on the database connections using the built-in SQL Editor.

<b>Data Modeling (Design):</b> Enables you to create models of your database schema graphically, reverse and forward engineering between a schema and a live database, and edit all aspects of your database using the comprehensive Table Editor. The Table Editor provides easy-to-use facilities for editing Tables, Columns, Indexes, Triggers, Partitioning, Options, Inserts and Privileges, Routines and Views.

<b>Server Administration:</b> Enables you to administer MySQL server instances by administering users, performing backup and recovery, inspecting audit data, viewing database health, and monitoring the MySQL server performance.

<b>Data Migration:</b> Allows you to migrate from Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Sybase ASE, SQLite, SQL Anywhere, PostreSQL, and other RDBMS tables, objects and data to MySQL. Migration also supports migrating from earlier versions of MySQL to the latest releases.

<b>MySQL Enterprise Support:</b> Support for Enterprise products such as MySQL Enterprise Backup, MySQL Firewall, and MySQL Audit.

<b>SCOPE - To Cover the following topics using MySQL Workbench 8.0:</b>
<p></p>


<p></p>
<b>1. MySQL Installation:</b> Install MySQL in your local machine from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/ 

<p></p>
<b>2. Server Connection Creation:</b> After Downloading the required software package in your local system, you can create a Test Connection to your MySQL Server. Here I have used a Test Connection named 'AviMuks_Test'. Make sure to test the connection is working successfully and check the connection settings before going to the next step


<p></p>
<b>3. Sample Database Creation within the Schema:</b> After creating the Test Connection, you can create a sample Database/Schema with the required Character Set in the Schema Editor. I have used the Database called "TestDB".


<p></p>
<b>4. Sample Table Creation within a Database:</b> You can Create sample tables from the create Table wizard within a Database. I have created 'Sample Employee_AM' Table from the create table wizard here under the "TestDB".


<p></p>
<b>5. Import Table within a Database:</b> You can also import a .csv format file from your local machine for instance using the 'Table Data Import Wizard' under Tables in MySQL Workbench. I have imported the sample dowloaded file from the web 'uk bank customer.csv' & 'Traffic Violations.csv' as it is witihn within the "TestDB".


<p></p>
<b>6. Run Queries:</b> Once you have the Database setup, you can execute the queries to get the expected result and view them in the Output Pane.
